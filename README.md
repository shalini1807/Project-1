# Project-1

This is our submission for Project 1 with Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp.

The Notebook files can be found above in this repo.

There are 3 sub folders containing some .csv data files and some figures. The notebooks above will need a file called config.py that contains your api key. The api key will need to be called api_key.
